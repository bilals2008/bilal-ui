# Introduction

Welcome to **Bilal UI**, a carefully crafted collection of premium UI components designed for modern web applications. Our mission is to provide developers with highly aesthetic, accessible, and high-performance components that make your projects stand out.

## Why Bilal UI?

- **Modern Aesthetics**: Designed with 2025 standards in mind—vibrant colors, glassmorphism, and smooth animations.
- **Copy & Paste**: No complex installation. Find a component you like, copy the code, and drop it into your project.
- **Fully Customizable**: Built on top of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for maximum flexibility.
- **TypeScript First**: First-class support for TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate Bilal UI into your project.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
```

### 2. Configure Utilities

Add the following `cn` helper to your `lib/utils.ts` file to handle Tailwind class merging:

```typescript
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

### 3. Usage

Browse the components in the sidebar, choose one, and follow the specific instructions on its page. Most components are designed to be "grab and go."
