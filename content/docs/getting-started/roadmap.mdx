  This roadmap is a living document. We prioritize features based on community feedback.
</Callout>

## Phase 1: Alpha (Current)
*Target: Initial Community Feedback*

We are building the core foundation of Bilal UI, focusing on the most essential components and the developer experience.

* **Project Foundation**: Next.js 16, Tailwind 4, and Framer Motion setup.
* **Documentation Shell**: A high-performance, beautiful documentation site.
* **Core Components**: Buttons, Inputs, Cards, and Navigation.
* **Theme System**: Advanced color customisation and premium dark mode.
* *Initial Animation Pack: Entry/exit animations for common UI elements.*

## Phase 2: Beta
*Target: Reliability and Variety*

Once the foundation is solid, we will expand the library with more specialized and "copy-paste" secondary components.

* Complex Components: Data tables, Calendars, and interactive Modals.
* Specialized Effects: Animated backgrounds, text effects, and glassmorphism utilities.
* Template Collection: Starter landing page sections and hero components.
* Community Request Flow: A formal way for users to request new components.

## Phase 3: Stable (v1.0)
*Target: Production Excellence*

The milestone where Bilal UI is considered fully enterprise-ready and stable.

* Full Test Coverage: Ensuring every component is bulletproof.
* Performance Audit: Extreme optimization for zero-runtime overhead where possible.
* Accessibility (a11y): Full compliance with accessibility standards across all components.
* CLI Tool: A custom CLI to easily add components to your project.
